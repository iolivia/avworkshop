On Tuesday, September 26, we are being hosted by Amazon for a 2 hours workshop on how to build Amazon Video! 

Interested in learning about Amazon Video, all the moving parts of a live streaming application and the complexities of running on multiple platforms?  Come join us for a workshop at Amazon Video! 

You will learn how to design a video streaming application and together we will build a very simple application much like Amazon Video.

Make sure you bring your laptop since this is a hands-on session. Experience with Python will help but it's not mandatory, we'll provide guidance on all the steps of the workshop and you'll be able to ask questions as we go. You'll need to have the following installed:

* Python and tools (also make sure they are set in your PATH so you can easily use pip from the command line)
- Python 3.6.2
- Pip

* Code editor of choice (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.)

* Git (any version should be fine)

* Chrome or Firefox 

The agenda is:
<times> Lightning talk from Annie 
<times> Amazon Video Player Workshop
<times> Networking (food and drinks provided)
